# MAR-KEY
Mar-key is a handy tool for the employees of Paradise Theatre and a unique idea to help make manually adjusting the tiles on their analogue marquee display just a little bit easier! Mar-key stores the width and stock of each marquee block/tile and can allow the user to update this if block/tiles break, are lost or new block/tiles are acquired.

It has a few use cases:
1. Determine if the message you want to display will fit on the marquee(s).
2. Determine if you have enough characters based on current inventory levels.
3. Output a tally of all of the chracter tiles the user will need to retrieve from storage.

Mar-key will provide immediate validation BEFORE you submit your entry. So if your entry will be too long OR if you don't have enough of a particular character the user will receive feedback and not be allowed to submit the marquee/row that they are focused on.

# Experience Gained:
- UseReducer and complex state management (without needing Redux)
- forwardRef
- UseRef with an array of values assigned from mapping a List
- Client-side validation
- Staggered css animations
- Styled-components (global styling, variables, nested selector styling)
- Used native HTML to create essentially a unique mini game/tool with custom components and logic
- Firebase deployment, auth and their realtime database.
- Learned that I should spend much more time in design before starting projects ;)
