# MARKEY

Mar-key is a handy tool for the employees of Paradise Theatre!

It has a few use cases:

1. Determine if the message you want to display will fit on the marquee(s)
2. Determine if you have enough characters based on current inventory levels and what is already up on display.
3. Determine which letters you'll need to retrieve based on the marquee's current display and what you would like to change it to.

Mar-key will provide immediate validation BEFORE you submit your entry if your entry will be too long OR if you don't have enough of a particular character.

# Experience Gained:

- useReducer and complex state management (w.o needing Redux)
- ref forwarding
- useRef (with an array)
- client-side validation
- staggered css animations
- styled-components
- react-query w. Axios
